# Constructor-Hangman

Created an Animal themed Hangman application that processes user input via the command line. The technologies used to create this app are as follows: Node.js, Javascript, NPM inquirer, NPM require, constructors, and objects. 
In order to play, clone the repo, run NPM install in the command line, and start guessing!
